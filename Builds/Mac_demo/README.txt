This is the document file for "Project advanture demo". The file includes a basic introduction about game control.


Movement: "Arrow keys" controls walking; pressing "Left Shift" plus "Arrow Keys" controls running; "Space Bar" indicates jumping.

Mouse Action: "Left Button" selects shrines, and any other button interfaces. "Right Button" call out skill circle. "Middle Button" cast skills.


Use a shrine: "Left click" on the shrine when move your character close enough to it, then select a combination of numbers and a symbol to calculate an

equivalent value as shown on the right hand side. After selection, "Left click" on "answer", if the equation is correct, the character could gain a unique

skill.



Cast a skill: After using a shrine to gain a skill, "Right click" on anywhere else to open skill circle, "Left click" on the skill that just gained from the

shrine. Then the skill would be armed. "Middle click" mouse when you point mouse on a direction or a special object(color in white, no texture on it) to use spell.


The game would probably freeze at the beginning of a new level, please press "Esc" and click "Resume" to continue the game.


Enjoy!!

P.S. This is only a demo, therefore, everything inside the game still would be modified. Any comments would be helpful, and I would really appreciate that.

P.S.2. Hope there is no typo in this file.....
